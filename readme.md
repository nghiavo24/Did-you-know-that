# Project 1: Trivia game - Did you know that?
## Trivia History
Trivia is defined as little-known facts or unimportant matters. Examples of trivia are details of a fight that happened decades ago. An example of trivia is a game in which team members race to see who can be the first to answer questions about insiginificant facts of history, popular culture, art and science.

Nowsaday, trivia night is more popular than ever and showing up on event calendars at bars, breweries, and restaurants - even local coffee shops and senior centers. It creates a sense of community and a lively atmosphere that invites more people to join in the fun.

You will have to select at least one answer to advance to the next question. When you click on the question, the answer and background will change their background color to Green (the answer is correct) or Red (the answer is incorrect).
